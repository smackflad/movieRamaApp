# movieRamaApp

For the front end simple react app implemented with the challenge of getting familiar with animations in single page applications. Used animate.css and framer-motion to implement the applications.

For the backend, nestjs app with a postgress database. Implemented App functions like user register/login, post creation, post reaction etc.

Also for installation purposes implemented a full docker container system. Set the containers with docker compose by cloning the repository and simply run ```docker-compose up```
